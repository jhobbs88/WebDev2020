    <h1>DOM Events</h1>
    
    <p>
      <dfn>Events</dfn> are actions that take place in the browser. They can be initiated by the user or by the browser itself. Below are a few examples of common events that can happen on a website:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The page finishes loading</li>
      <li>The user clicks a button</li>
      <li>The user hovers over a dropdown</li>
      <li>The user submits a form</li>
      <li>The user presses a key on their keyboard</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A JavaScript function that runs when an event takes place is called an <dfn>event handler</dfn>. There are three ways to tell the browser that a function should be used as an event handler:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Event listeners</li>
      <li>Event handler properties</li>
      <li>Inline event handler attributes</li>
    </ul>
      
    <h2>Example</h2>
    
    <label for="name">Enter your name:</label>
    <input id="name">
    <button id="submit">Submit</button>
  </body>
</html>
