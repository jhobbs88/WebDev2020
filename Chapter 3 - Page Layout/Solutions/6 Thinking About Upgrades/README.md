In order of most import first, I would make the following changes:

1. **Select a new font for headings.**  
  This will help distinguish headings from body text, and also give the styling of the website a stronger visual identity/brand.

2. **Have the book collections on the front page run horizontally, not vertically.**  
  This way the user can better focus on one collection at a time.

3. **Combine the two navigation menus at the top of the page.**  
  The two separate menus may be confusing, especially as typically users will expect there to be one menu and will miss the other one.

4. **Make the book cover images on the homepage larger.**  
  Currently some covers are too small to be easily legible or have an effective visual impact on the user.

5. **Replace the grey background with a white one.**  
  The background is distracting and does not look particularly nice. Removing reduces the amount of visual information on the page and makes it clearer to the user what to look at.

6. **Remove the contact form on the "Contact us" page.**  
  Most users will only want to email or phone, and as their phone number and email address are already given on the page, the complicated contact us form is not needed. If users do need to share their address or other information the form asks for, they can still do so over phone or email, but only when it is needed instead of upfront.
