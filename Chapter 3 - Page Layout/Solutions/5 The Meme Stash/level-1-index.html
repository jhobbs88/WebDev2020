# WHAT CHANGES WERE MADE?

## Change #1
All the <PLACEHOLDER> elements were replaced with their semantically correct element.
Some elements have been commented to explain why that element type was used.

## Change 2
<link rel="stylesheet" href="level-1-example-style.css"> was added to the `head` element.
This links the HTML to the CSS, meaning the HTML elements will be styled by the CSS in the linked file.
