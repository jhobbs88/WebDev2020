            <p>
                <dfn>CSS animations</dfn> make it possible to animate transitions from one CSS style configuration to another. Animations consist of two components, a family of properties for configuring the animation and a set of keyframes that describe the start and end states of the animationâ€™s style, as well as possible intermediate waypoints.
