# Web Development Workbook

## Getting Started

### Setting up an IDE
Class demonstrations are taught using Brackets, which is installed on all the G32 PCs. If you are using your own laptop you can use any IDE you like, or download Brackets from http://brackets.io/. You should make sure to set up an IDE on your home computer so you can practice programming with web technologies at home.

### Using this workbook
Each chapter covers a different HTML, CSS, or JavaScript technique. We will work through the chapters in class, however you should also work on exercises outside of class to help your understanding.

On GitHub, each chapter has a "README.md" file. This file contains all of the exercises for the chapter, and GitHub will display it to you at the bottom of the web page when you click on a chapter. Chapters will also have an additional folder for each exercise that has starter code - you should copy and paste this code into your IDE when doing the exercise.

Each exercise in a chapter is harder than the previous, so it is recommended that you work through them in order. If you are already familiar with HTML, CSS, and/or JavaScript, you may wish to start with the harder exercises. Additionally, you may wish to try the bonus exercises, or come up with ways to expand on the exercises given.

Once you have completed an exercise and when you finish a workshop, you should save your progress so far and commit it to your personal GitHub repository.

## Reading Lists
Each chapter includes a 'Reading List' and an 'Additional Resources' sections, which include articles explaining certain techniques or documentation pages that give a technical breakdown of the techniques. It is highly recommended that you read these to help develop a thorough understanding of the web technologies you are using.

## Spot an error?
If you spot an error in this workbook, you can raise it as an issue on GitHub via the "Issues" tab, or let me know in class.
