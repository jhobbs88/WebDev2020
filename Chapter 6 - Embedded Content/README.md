# Exercises

## 1. Test Your Skills
* Complete [these exercises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Video_and_audio_content/Test_your_skills:_Multimedia_and_embedding) on MDN relating to multimedia and embedding.
* You may ignore the requirement to add text tracks (Multimedia and embedding 2) and the requirement to embed a PDF file (Multimedia and embedding 3).

## 2. Soundboard
* Create a web-based soundboard, that is, a web page that allows users to trigger sounds by clicking on different buttons.
* The sounds to be used are available in the exercises folder. You may also compile/record a collection of sounds yourself if you wish to do so.

## 3. Video Sampler
* Create a web-based video sample, that is, a web page that allows users to trigger short video clips by clicking on different buttons.
* Only a single `<video>` element should be used. The default controls should not be displayed.
* The videos to be used are available in the exercises folder. Again, you may also compile/make a collection of short video clips yourself.

NOTE: for both the soundboard and video sampler exercises try to avoid using if or switch statements to control which sound/video is played following a click event and develop an implementation using JavaScript arrays.

## 4. Additional Features
* Implement loop and volume controls (and optionally also a playback rate control) for both the soundboard and the video sampler you have created in exercises 2 and 3.
* Implement a ‘Random’ feature that executes a random sequence of sounds/videos and allow the user to control the length and speed of the sequence.

## 5. Custom Video Player
* Follow the custom video player example given in the MDN article Video and Audio APIs (also listed in the reading list section above).
* Enhance the example following the suggestions given in the summary section of the article.
