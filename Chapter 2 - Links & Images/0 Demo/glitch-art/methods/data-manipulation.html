        <h3>Data Manipulation</h3>
        <p>
            Data manipulation covers a range of approaches and protocols, all of which are focused on the transformation and alteration of the digital file itself: its dataset is changed to induce aberrant results when "played" normally on a computer. These varieties of glitching are the most immediately recognized as being glitch, and are readily apparent as specific, named protocols such as "data moshing" in which a video file compressed using MPEG-1 has crucial image data removed (the I-frames), resulting in a cascading failure as the motion data is not refreshed with corresponding image data; Takeshi Murata's <cite>Monster Movie</cite> employed this technique to produce its distinctive effects. Other variants of data manipulation, such as "data bending" involve the introduction of transient errors into the datastream that also produce cascading failures. The occasional "drop-outs" in digital video feeds (commonly seen during bad weather) are common examples of these transformations. Direct transformations of data to introduce errors and overflows when the file is rendered for a human audience overlap with transformations of the data using incorrect and inappropriate software, resulting in convergent results when encountered in human readable form.
