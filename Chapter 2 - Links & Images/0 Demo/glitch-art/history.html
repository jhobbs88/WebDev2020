        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            In a technical sense, a <dfn>glitch</dfn> is the unexpected result of a malfunction, especially occurring in software, video games, images, videos, audio, and other digital artefacts. Early examples of glitches used in media art include <cite>Digital TV Dinner</cite> (1978) created by Jamie Fenton and Raul Zaritsky, with glitch audio done by Dick Ainsworth. This video was made by manipulating the Bally video game console and recording the results on videotape.

            The term glitch came to be associated with music in the mid 90s to describe a genre of experimental/noise/electronica. Shortly after, as VJs and other visual artist began to embrace the glitch as an aesthetic of the digital age, glitch art came to refer to a whole assembly of visual arts.
