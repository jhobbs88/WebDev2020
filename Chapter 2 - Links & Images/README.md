## 1. Relative URLs
Consider the following project file structure:

![Image not found. Try looking in the exercise folder.](<1 Relative URLs/file-structure.png>)

For each of the following, write down the relative URL linking from A to B. Paper or digital is fine.

1. A: `index.html`    B: `file1.html`
2. A: `file2.html`    B: `index.html`
3. A: `file4.html`    B: `file5.html`
4. A: `file6.html`    B: `file3.html`

## 2. Recipe Revisited
Add at least two hyperlinks and two images to the recipe you made last week (chapter 1, exercise 4 - "Recipe").
* The hyperlinks should refer to external web pages and open in a new tab when clicked (hint: `target="_blank"`).
* Add a caption to each image using the `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` elements.
* Donâ€™t forget to give each image an `alt` attribute with an appropriate value.

## 3. Shady CSS
Create a copy of the starter code in the `3 Shady CSS` exercise folder. Edit `shadows.css` so that the four `div` elements in `index.html` look like this:

[Advanced styling effects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Advanced_styling_effects) contains information about the different ways you can create shadows in CSS. *Hint: You will need to use three different CSS properties.*

## 4. Gradient Patterns
* Read [Using CSS gradients](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Images/Using_CSS_gradients) and explore the pattern galleries linked at the end of the guide.
* Copy and tweak the CSS to understand how it works.
* Come up with at least one original gradient pattern.

## 5. Image Hitmap
Read [Add a hitmap on top of an image](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Add_a_hit_map_on_top_of_an_image) and create an image hitmap.
You may choose whatever images you want, but here are a couple of ideas:
* Images of human anatomy with links to relevant Wikipedia pages.
* Where's Wally?-like images with links to hidden characters.

## 6. Collage
People have found ways of using CSS to create art! e.g. https://codepen.io/ivorjetski/pen/xxGYWQG That example is complicated! Instead, create a photo collage using images from the internet.

You should:
* Use multiple images.
* Use the CSS `filter` property.
* Use At least two other CSS features (e.g. shadows, borders, gradients, etc).
* Put all your images inside a separate `images` folder.
* Think about how you are going to make your collage look good - and not just a random pile of images.

## 7. Multipage Website
Create a multipage website like the Glitch Art website demonstrated in the seminar session (or `see 2-links-and-images/class-demo-gp` in your `code-portfolio` repository).

Your website should include:
* A navigation menu with links styled as buttons
* At least one background image
* Box shadow and filter effects
