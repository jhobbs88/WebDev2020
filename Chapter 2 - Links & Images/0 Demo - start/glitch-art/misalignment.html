        <h3>Misalignment</h3>
        <p>
            Misalignment between a digital file and the software that reads that file has two mirror-like variants: the first produces errors through the inappropriate application of decompression by decoding of a compressed file using an incorrect codec, resulting in a transformation of the encoded data, but without damaging the file itself; the second involves the induced opening/reading of a file using an incorrect software application. For example, opening a motion-encoded video file as audio, manipulating the audio-version of the dataset, then engaging the results either as audio, or returning it to be video again. Both these approaches involve mismatches between encoded data and its decoding, resulting in aberrant results when rendered for a human audience. Rosa Menkman's glitch-generating software <cite>Monglot</cite> creates its effects through the misalignment of encoded data with the codec for decoding it.
